## Description: 
- COVID educational resources. A simple way to find back to school activities, resources and tutors. Helping COVID impacted families with free educational resources ahead of the mandated at home learning policies. Not going back to school will be a large change for families and the website will provide resources for at home resources, curriculum resources, school supplies, and virtual interaction for kids. The second page will collect a list of tutors for certain subjects and levels.
