# Vision

What is the vision of this product?

The vision of this product is to provide COVID educational resources to parents; providing a simple way to find back to school activities, resources and tutors.  

What pain point does this project solve?

Helping COVID impacted families with free educational resources ahead of the mandated at home learning policies. Not going back to school will be a large change for families and the website will provide resources for at home resources, curriculum resources, school supplies, and virtual interaction for kids. The second page will collect a list of tutors for certain subjects and levels.

Why should we care about your product?

These are difficult times for everyone during the pandemic, especially parents and their school aged children.  As the school year quickly approaches and everyone prepares to go back to school without actually going back to school, parents are encountering a new situation.  Parents need new resources to help them find the best way and resources to begin school instruction and children socialization, many while working at home themselves.  This website helps create a better learning environment for our children in this peculiar time and educates our future while keeping them safe.
