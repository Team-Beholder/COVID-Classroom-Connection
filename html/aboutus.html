        <p>Hi there, Krystian here! I am currently learning everything it takes to be a software developer at CodeFellows. When I am not bunkered down at my desk, you can find me outside with my four dogs, trying out new Korean restaurants, or playing video games. I have a background in Military Intelligence Operations, and aspire to work in the field of Cybersecurity once I complete my studies at CodeFellows. If you'd like to learn more about me, or just grab a virtual coffee and chat.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, thank you for joining us during our project today. My name is Marchael Acode. I'm currently a
          student at Code Fellows working to become a full stack web developer. Before joining Code Fellows, I worked in the
          hospitality industry as a restaurant server. I decided to learn Software Development because I needed a career
          change and also thought coding was intriguing. Learning how to code is a dynamic skill to have and can benefit an
          individual in any aspect of their life. I am hoping through this experience I will be one step closer to achieving
          my career goal of becoming a video game developer or video game designer. I'm inspired by the joy and feeling that
          video games brought me while I was growing up. I want to pay it forward by creating a video game that brings the
          same joy to another person.

        <p>Hi - I’m Michael Mandell and I’m a software developer. I like working with cutting edge technology. I love to
          find new code or apps that are new and changing our businesses and personal needs. I’ve always been an early
          adopter of new technology. I’ve used many beta versions of software in my profession. I want to be on the
          cutting edge of technology with mobile devices. I love a good challenge and I like to have fun tackling those
          challenges. I use to have the first version of Palm Pilots, iPhone, Windows Phone, and then found the android
          phones. I root my android so I can test and use beta software. Mostly apps for personal needs like AirDroid.

        <p>After 13 years as a mechanical/aerospace engineer, I am excited to learn a new skill to challenge myself and maintain technological knowledge. The field of software development intrigues me because of its fast turn around and shorter schedules. Creating
          and producing things is enjoyable and fulfilling. I want to live the product lifecycle on a scale that is
          shorter than a decade. Not to mention, the ability software possesses to scale and affect so much of the world
          comes with a lot of power to change the world.</p>
